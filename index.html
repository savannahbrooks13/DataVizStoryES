          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p> <a href="https://savannahbrooks13.github.io/DataVizStoryES/">Hartford Promise</a> is a Hartford-based non-profit that aims to “transform the lives of thousands of Hartford students through an integrated college success model that provides them the financial resources, support services, & key relationships that lead to college success and economic mobility.” Hartford Promise provides a college scholarship up to $5,000 ($2,500 for two-year schools) to any Hartford public school student that is a Hartford resident, has a 93% attendance record or better, and has at least a 3.0 GPA. Hartford Promise wants its students to succeed, so understanding where Hartford Promise Scholars have been most successful is important to the organization. Through analyzing the dataset from Hartford Promise, we will be able to identify where students are successful and compare Hartford Promise Scholars to other students at different institutions. Hartford Promise, with this information, will be able to better advise and mentor its students to help them succeed in college.
</p>

          <p>In the dataset we are analyzing from Hartford Promise there are 254 students who enrolled in a higher education institution. Of the 254 students who enrolled in a higher education institution half earned bachelor’s degrees.  We are looking to analyze the success of 92 Hartford Promise Scholars who started at private 4-year institutions. To complete this, we will first look to see how many students successfully completed their education and identify where students have been most successful. We will also look at success data from the individual universities that Hartford Promise Scholars attended to compare their success rate against the general study body at the school as well as relevant subgroups.

           <iframe title="Hartford Promise Scholars Excel at Public 4-year Universities " aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-UKCwR" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UKCwR/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="291" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

          <p>Explore the <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/UKCwR/?v=4">interactive chart</a> <p>
            
          </p>Overall, we know that 50.4% of Hartford Promise Scholars from the 2016 and 2017 cohorts earned a bachelor’s degree from a 4-year college. But how does that percentage break down between public versus private colleges? To answer this question we first compared the success rates for Hartford Promise Scholars in public and private 4-year colleges to the success rates of the entire student body at colleges where Hartford Promise Scholars enrolled. We found that Hartford Promise Scholars were less successful compared to their peers at private 4-year colleges, but were much more successful compared to peers at public 4-year institutions. This was different when looking at public colleges where Hartford Promise Scholars performed better than the average student. Of the colleges the Hartford Promise Scholars enrolled in, the average graduation rate is 51%, compared to 86% of Hartford Promise scholars that start at a 4-year public institution earn a degree.</p>
       <p>Hartford Promise Scholars performing better at public colleges compared to private colleges is important. This will allow Hartford Promise to give the best counsel to students when it comes to where they will be most successful. As the data shows, Hartford Promise Scholars are most successful at public colleges. The data also allows Hartford Promise to examine why students who attend private 4-year institutions are less successful on average than their peers. Hartford Promise then can use this to better support and advise students who attend private 4-year colleges.

          <iframe title="Hartford Promise Scholars Perform More Similarly with Pell Grant Students at Private 4-year" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Ht7Bp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ht7Bp/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="291" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

           <p>Explore the <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Ht7Bp/?v=2">interactive chart</a> <p>
             <p>Another way to gauge the success of Hartford Promise Scholars is to compare their graduation rates against all college students who were eligible for federal Pell Grants. Students who are eligible for Pell Grants display exceptional financial need and have not earned a higher degree than a high school diploma. This comparison is meaningful because Hartford is a low-income city with a median household income of $37,477, which is less than half the median household income for the United States.  Analyzing the success rates of students who have Pell Grants is a good comparison to Hartford Promise Scholars, as students in the program come from Hartford which is a low-income community, creating a more equitable comparison to examine how low income students succeed at colleges where Hartford Promise Scholars enrolled. We found that success rates at private 4-year institutions for Hartford Promise Scholars (55%) is 13.99 percentage points lower than the graduation rate for students with Pell Grants (68.99%). This is a smaller percentage point difference than comparing Hartford Promise Scholars to the general student body, demonstrating that students on Pell Grants at private 4-year colleges perform more similarly to Hartford Promise Scholars. When looking at public 4-year colleges Hartford Promise Scholars (86%) outperform students on Pell Grants (47.47%) with a 38.53 percentage point difference. Pell Grant students at public colleges perform, on average, worse than the general student body, creating an even larger difference between the graduation rates of Hartford Promise Scholars and Pell Grant recipients. Through this comparison, one can see that Hartford Promise Scholars still are not thriving at 4-year public colleges. 
             </p>
          <p>Understanding that Hartford Promise Scholars underperform when looking at private 4-year universities is important because it will allow Hartford Promise to analyze the differences that occur with students when attending a private school. This will allow Hartford Promise to better advise their students and increase success rates at 4-year private institutions. 
</p>
          <iframe title="Graduation Rates of Hartford Promise Students and All Students at Select Institutions" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-ne3bG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ne3bG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="323" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
          <p>One key insight we noticed when analyzing the Hartford Promise and College Scorecard data was that Hartford Promise students did not generally see as much success as their peers at private four-year universities. Since there were only three private four-year universities where five or more Hartford Promise students have enrolled, we completed a case study on those three colleges: Springfield College, Goodwin College, and the University of Saint Joseph. At all three colleges, Hartford Promise students had at least a 10% difference between graduation rates from their peers. Goodwin College in particular seems to be a trouble spot for Hartford Promise students — while their graduation rate for all students is not particularly high at 29%, no Hartford Promise student that attended Goodwin College graduated from there, which is notable. This data can help Hartford Promise advise students when it comes to applying to and choosing colleges; for instance, Goodwin College likely does not provide an environment that produces successful strategies from low-income students. This could be due to the college accepting students that did not have the resources or education to succeed at their college.

          <h2>Sources and Methods</h2>
         <p>Our two sources were the Hartford Promise dataset our community partners provided as well as the <a href='https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/'>College Scorecard</a> dataset found publicly online. First we filtered the Hartford Promise dataset for only 4-year colleges and then further filtered the schools by public and private. We created a pivot table calculating the numbers of starters at private 4-year and public 4-year universities. We did this by using the filter instance = 1 which provided us with where Hartford Promise Scholars first enrolled. While this method does not account for transfers we felt that this was the best way to analyze the data because we want to help Hartford Promise advise students on the best colleges for their needs, and focusing on original placements without needing to transfer is an important part of that process. After finding the starters at private and public 4-year colleges we then created another pivot table finding how many bachelor's degrees were earned at public 4-year and private 4-year. 
         </p>
          <p>We then began to analyze the College Scorecard data by recording the graduation rates in 150% of normal time for the schools where Hartford Promise Scholars enrolled. Next, we averaged the graduation rates for private 4-year and public 4-year colleges to find the average graduation rates of students at these colleges and compared them against the percentage of starters who earned a bachelor’s degree. The same data collection process applied to students on Pell Grants. Using the College Scorecard data set we collected the graduation rate for students on Pell Grants who graduated in 150% of normal time and compared that to Hartford Promise Scholars. We broke it down even further, creating case studies for three private colleges that were well-attended by Hartford Promise students and comparing those particular students to their peers at the institutions they attended. A potential issue with our results is that the transfer students we include are not necessarily starters at the school where they earned their degree, which would increase the graduation rates for Hartford Promise Scholars as more people enrolled at a school than started. However, we believe that we should still include the degrees transfer students earned to better represent the data. Through our analysis using data from Hartford Promise and College Scorecard we were able to have a better understanding of the success of Hartford Promise students at private and public 4-year colleges.

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>
